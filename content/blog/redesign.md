For the third time, I decided to redesign my personal website. What made this time different was that I rewrote it entirely. The new design is entirely custom. Like last time, it's written in TailwindCSS and NuxtJS. Both are really awesome frameworks that I encourage you to check out.

### Inspiration

I was originally inspired to make this website when [IO](https://jcde.xyz) started making their site. It looked awesome, and I was honestly ashamed to look at my site. This current site is the fruit of my work.
